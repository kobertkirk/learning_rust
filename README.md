# Rust Learning Journey: Guessing Game

Welcome to my Rust learning journey! This repository contains a simple guessing game project that I developed as part of my exploration into the Rust programming language.

## Project Overview

The guessing game is a command-line application where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. Players can exit the game at any time by typing "exit" or "quit".

## Learning Objectives

This project is part of my journey to learn Rust, and it covers several key concepts:

1. **Understanding Rust Basics**: Types, variables, and functions.
2. **Exploring Modules**: How to organize code effectively.
3. **Building a Simple Application**: Applying Rust concepts in a practical project.
4. **Error Handling and User Input**: Managing user input and handling errors gracefully.
5. **Using External Crates**: Experimenting with crates like `rand` for random number generation.

## How to Run the Project

To run the guessing game, you need to have Rust installed on your system. You can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learning_rust.git
   cd learning_rust/guessing_game
